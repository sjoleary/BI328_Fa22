### Data Analysis

Let's start by pulling in your data

```{r}

albedo <- read_delim("data/albed_temps.csv", delim = ",") %>%
  clean_names() %>%
  separate(location, into = c("location", "sunshine"), sep = 1)

```

We need to calculate the difference between material temperature and airport temperature

```{r}

albedo <- albedo %>%
  mutate(temp_diff = surface_temp_c - airport_air_temp_c)

```

Now we can look at the relationship 

```{r}

ggplot(albedo, aes(x = airport_air_temp_c, y = temp_diff, shape = sunshine, color = sunshine)) +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0) +
  facet_grid(. ~ location)
  

```

Let's look at albedo for each location/sunshine

```{r}

ggplot(albedo, aes(x = location, y = albedo_broad, shape = date_time, color = sunshine)) +
  geom_point(size = 3)

```

We are going to use the mean albedo for the sunny days as our albedo

```{r}

mean_albedo <- albedo %>%
  group_by(location, sunshine) %>%
  summarize(albedo = mean(albedo_broad)) %>%
  filter(sunshine == "A") %>%
  select(location, albedo)

albedo <- albedo %>%
  left_join(mean_albedo)

```

Now we can plot albedo vs temp difference

```{r}

ggplot(albedo, aes(x = albedo, y = temp_diff, color = location)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_point(size = 3) +
  facet_grid(. ~ sunshine)
  

```



## Author Contributions

Typical categories include: Conceive study, design study, project/task management, data collection, data management, data analysis, visualizations, write/design manuscript/poster draft, revise & edit draft.

Write about 5-7 sentences about how you contributed to this project and what you learned about the process from the wibbly-wobbly method of just diving right in and designing your own study this semester.


## If I (we) were to design this study all over again ...

Find at least three points for improvement/lessons learned about the study design itself (separate from what you learned about the process). Discuss this with your team members but you should write your own revisions in about 7-10 sentences.


## Further work: Next steps and new questions based on our pilot study ...

Discuss with your team mates to identify new questions you have identified, how you might expand and refine the study (beyond just re-designing the pilot study), assume that you are not limited by the constraints of lab time within a course.
